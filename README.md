# ortega
Command-line memorisation tool
ortega is a general-purpose learning tool modelled loosely off Duolingo.
While currently more of a flash-card app for the terminal, perhaps sometime in
the future more advanced grading techniques will be added.

When studying for an exam, or learning something, simply break the topic into
parts, add them as questions in a csv file as per the correct format, then
parse the csv into the database.
Revise, test yourself, and analyse your grades over time.
